1. *Resume Relevance Score (0-100)*  
   Calculate a score reflecting the resume’s alignment with the job description based on keyword matches.  
   - Prioritize technical skills, programming languages, methodologies, and industry-specific terms.  
   - Assign higher weight to keywords in the skills, experience, and projects sections.  
   - Consider synonyms and contextual relevance (e.g., "Python" and "Python 3").

2. *Role Fit Score (0-100)*  
   Evaluate how well the candidate’s experience matches the job requirements.  
   - Assess years of experience, job titles, responsibilities, and project relevance.  
   - Emphasize hands-on expertise and practical application of skills over theoretical knowledge.

3. *Matched Keywords*  
   List all keywords from the job description found in the resume, including variations and synonyms (e.g., "machine learning" and "ML").  
   - Ensure the list is comprehensive and relevant to the role.

4. *Missing Keywords and Skills*  
   Identify critical keywords and skills from the job description absent in the resume.  
   - Focus on terms likely to impact applicant tracking system (ATS) filtering (e.g., specific tools or certifications).  
   - Separate keywords (e.g., "Agile") from skills (e.g., "Agile project management").

5. *Resume Optimization Recommendations*  
   Provide exactly 10 actionable suggestions to improve the resume’s alignment with the job description.  
   - Focus on enhancing keyword visibility, ATS compatibility, and clarity in skills, experience, and projects.
   - Ensure recommendations are specific (e.g., "Add 'Docker' to the skills section" rather than "Add technical skills").
   - Ensure that each point is big like 2 lines and also highlight the main keywords with bold ** here i will use markdown formar in web app

6. *Course Recommendations for Missing Skills*  
    For each missing skill, recommend exactly **three high-quality courses** that help address the skill gap. The recommendations must follow this structure:

    - Provide **two courses** from **paid platforms** such as Coursera, Udemy, or edX.
    - Provide **one free course** from **YouTube** as an accessible alternative.

    Each course must include the following details:
    - **course_name**: The title of the course.  
    - **platform**: E.g., Coursera, Udemy, edX, or YouTube.  
    - **description**: A concise summary of what the course covers and how it addresses the missing skill.  
    - **difficulty_level**: Beginner, Intermediate, or Advanced.  
    - **course_link**: A valid URL to the course. If the exact course link is unavailable, use a placeholder like `https://platform.com/course`.

    Ensure recommendations are relevant to the specific missing skill and vary in difficulty if appropriate.
