  "cover_letter": "**Cover Letter**\n\nDear Hiring Manager,\n\nI am writing to express my enthusiastic interest in the Data Scientist position at your company, as advertised on [Platform where job was advertised]. With my strong foundation in data science, programming, and hands-on experience in developing data-driven solutions, I am confident that I possess the skills and qualifications necessary to excel in this role and contribute significantly to your team.\n\nDuring my B.Tech in CSE with a specialization in Data Science, I gained proficiency in programming languages such as Python, R, and SQL, along with key frameworks and technologies like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn. My project, 'CV Analytics Dashboard,' demonstrates my ability to leverage these tools to solve real-world problems. By using Gemini API, I developed an algorithm that assesses resume relevance, identifies missing skills, and suggests improvements. This showcases my expertise in GenAI, data analysis and my ability to create practical, impactful solutions.\n\nFurthermore, my internship experiences at InternPe provided me with valuable hands-on experience in applying OOPS & Data Structures concepts while developing games and applications. I utilized NumPy and Pandas for data manipulation on real-world datasets from Kaggle, honing my skills in data cleaning, preprocessing, and analysis. Additionally, my experience as an Assistant Tool Maker at Acme Tooling has equipped me with the ability to adapt and learn new technologies quickly. I developed intricate designs using CAD/CAM and SolidWorks software during this internship.\n\nI am eager to further discuss how my skills and experiences align with the requirements of the Data Scientist position. Thank you for considering my application. I am available for an interview at your earliest convenience and can be reached at udaykiranftw@gmail.com or +91 9398831577.\n\nSincerely,\nR SAI UDAY KIRAN"
