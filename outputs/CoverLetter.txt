  "cover_letter": "**Cover Letter**\n\nDear Hiring Manager,\n\nI am writing to express my enthusiastic interest in the AI Engineer position at ZySec AI, as advertised. ZySec AI's mission to enhance cybersecurity solutions through autonomous AI aligns perfectly with my passion for leveraging AI to solve complex real-world problems. I am particularly drawn to the opportunity to contribute to the advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) within a cutting-edge cybersecurity context.\n\nMy hands-on experience with deep learning and LLMs, combined with a strong understanding of PyTorch internals, makes me a strong candidate for this role. I have experience fine-tuning LLMs, such as developing a sentiment analysis model for YouTube comments, classifying emotions to gain insights into viewer reactions and engagement trends, with an option to download results as a PDF report for easy review and analysis. This project demonstrates my ability to build and deploy AI solutions from conception to implementation. I am also familiar with running standardized evaluations (e.g., MMLU, GSM8K, HELM, TruthfulQA) and interpreting metrics, which is crucial for benchmarking and optimizing model performance.\n\nFurthermore, my familiarity with quantization techniques such as GPTQ, AWQ, and QLoRA, along with my working knowledge of the Hugging Face ecosystem, positions me well to contribute to model compression and deployment readiness. I have actively contributed to open-source by building a scalable automated resume screening pipeline for handling 900+ resumes, reducing manual screening time by 90% and boosting recruitment efficiency with data driven shortlisting. This demonstrates my ability to implement and optimize AI workflows for real-world efficiency gains.\n\nI am confident that my skills and experiences align well with the requirements of the AI Engineer position at ZySec AI. I am eager to contribute to your team's efforts in pushing the boundaries of what's possible with LLMs in cybersecurity. Thank you for considering my application. I am available for an interview at your earliest convenience. You can reach me at 40harsha@gmail.com or (+91) 8886066070.\n\nSincerely,\nHarsha Vardhini Pendyala"
