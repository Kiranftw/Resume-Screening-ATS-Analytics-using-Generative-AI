  "cover_letter": "**Cover Letter**\n\nDear Hiring Manager,\n\nI am writing to express my enthusiastic interest in the AI Engineer position at ZySec AI, as advertised. ZySec AI's commitment to providing cutting-edge cybersecurity solutions through autonomous AI aligns perfectly with my passion for leveraging AI to solve real-world problems, and I am confident that my skills and experience make me a strong candidate for this role.\n\nMy hands-on experience with deep learning and large language models (LLMs) is directly applicable to the requirements of this position. I have experience in fine-tuning LLMs, including practical application of these models using Python, along with the relevant frameworks. My project, the 'CV Analytics Dashboard,' demonstrates my ability to develop an algorithm using a Gemini LLM to assess resume relevance based on job descriptions, extract missing skills, and recommend improvements. This showcases my skills in model development, data analysis, and GenAI.\n\nFurthermore, I am familiar with the Hugging Face ecosystem, including Transformers, Accelerate, and Datasets. Although my profile doesn't yet contain a public model/repo, I am actively developing and refining my work, and I am eager to contribute to open-source communities in the near future. I am also familiar with PyTorch internals. This aligns well with the requirement of the job.\n\nI am excited about the opportunity to contribute to ZySec AI's mission of making AI more efficient and accessible for security professionals. My skills in LLM fine-tuning, combined with my experience in data manipulation and model development, would enable me to make a significant contribution to your team.\n\nThank you for considering my application. I am eager to learn more about this exciting opportunity and discuss how my skills and experience can benefit ZySec AI. I can be reached at udaykiranftw@gmail.com or +91 9398831577.\n\nSincerely,\nR Sai Uday Kiran"
