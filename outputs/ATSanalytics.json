    "Recommendations": [
        "Enhance the **summary** section to more explicitly state your career goals and the specific type of role you are seeking. Tailor it to align with the requirements of the positions you're applying for to immediately grab the recruiter's attention.",
        "Quantify your achievements in the **experience** section by including metrics such as the number of PCBs designed, the impact of your optimization efforts (e.g., reduced costs, improved efficiency), or the size of the teams you collaborated with. This will add more weight to your accomplishments.",
        "In the **skills** section, consider adding specific technologies or software relevant to your field beyond just the broad categories. Mentioning specific versions or frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow for Python, specific database management tools) can showcase your expertise.",
        "For the **projects** section, provide more context on the challenges you faced and the solutions you implemented. Instead of just describing the project, highlight the problem-solving skills and technical expertise you demonstrated.",
        "In the **education** section, ensure that the dates are formatted consistently (e.g., Month Year - Month Year) for all entries. Also, consider adding relevant coursework or academic projects to showcase your skills and knowledge.",
        "While you have listed certifications, it would be beneficial to include the issuing organization and the date of completion. This will add credibility to your **certifications** and allow recruiters to verify them if needed.",
        "Consider adding a section for **Awards and Honors** if you have any academic or professional achievements that deserve recognition. This will further highlight your capabilities and differentiate you from other candidates."
