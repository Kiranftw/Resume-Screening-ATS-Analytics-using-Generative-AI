    "Recommendations": [
        "Add a professional **summary or objective** at the beginning of your resume to highlight your key skills and career goals. This helps recruiters quickly understand your value proposition.",
        "While you've listed both hard and soft skills, consider **quantifying** your soft skills with specific examples from your experience. For instance, instead of just listing 'Problem Solving,' describe a situation where you successfully solved a problem.",
        "For each work experience entry, provide a detailed **description** of your responsibilities and achievements. Use action verbs to showcase your contributions and quantify your impact whenever possible.",
        "In your projects section, focus on **results and outcomes**. Instead of just describing the project, highlight the impact it had or the value it created. Mention any specific metrics or achievements.",
        "Ensure **consistent formatting** throughout your resume, including font sizes, spacing, and bullet point styles. A well-formatted resume is easier to read and presents a professional image.",
        "Consider adding **keywords** from the job descriptions of positions you're applying for to your resume, especially in the skills and experience sections. This can help your resume get past automated screening systems.",
        "Proofread your resume carefully for any **spelling or grammatical errors**. Even minor mistakes can detract from your credibility and make your resume seem less polished."
