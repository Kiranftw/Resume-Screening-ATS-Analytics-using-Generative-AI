        "**Consolidate contact details:** Ensure all contact information (LinkedIn, GitHub) is presented clearly and accessibly for easy recruiter access and also include the full URL for the LinkedIn and Github",
        "**Quantify accomplishments:** Use numbers and metrics to highlight the impact of your work experience and projects. For example, 'Improved PCB manufacturability by X%' or 'Reduced error rate in age estimation by Y%'.",
        "**Elaborate on certifications:** Provide more context for your certifications, including the issuing organization, completion date, and any key skills or knowledge gained. for example 'Python Certification By Google'",
        "**Refine skills section:** Categorize skills more precisely (e.g., 'Programming Languages', 'Databases', 'Tools') and provide specific versions where relevant (e.g., 'Python 3.8', 'MySQL 8.0'). and add more Soft Skills",
        "**Standardize date formats:** Use a consistent date format throughout your resume (e.g., Month Year - Month Year) for clarity and professionalism. Consistency in formatting improves readability.",
        "**Add more details to your Projects:** Add the technologies that you used in your project in a seperate line in a bold format, Doing so, allows the reader to have a better understanding on what technologies you have experience on.",
        "**Consider adding a skills section**: The education Section lacks the important information. Add a skills section to improve the readability."
